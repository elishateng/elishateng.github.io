# Tidiness

## 1. Do you think that you are a tidy person?
Well, I don't know actually. I mean, I'm not terribly messy and I won't just let myself go stinky or anything, but there are definitely times when I'm too busy that I just forget to keep my room organized for example, or I just can't bother to wash my hair every day. So, I guess what'm trying to say is that I am pretty tidy but I'm not PERFECTLY tidy.

## 2. Is your home very tidy?
I think so. Thanks to my mom, everything is regularly cleaned and neatly put away. However, because I can get quite lazy sometimes, my room is probably the messiest in the household. Even so, I'd say it's still largely presentable, not really chaotic like some of my friends' rooms. So, yeah, my home is, for the most part, fairly tidy.

## 3. Do you think it's necessary to be tidy?
Yeah, sure. I think it's pretty important to keep your surroundings tidy, since, you know, you want to at least know where everything is, especially when you need them. That is not to say you have to keep your room spotless all the time though, but at least keep it tidy enough so that you can properly function as a human being.

## 4. Are you tidier at work(school) or at home?
I'd say at school probably, because I'd like to appear to be decent in front of other people. So I won't let my desk to be a complete mess. Also, I don't want to invade anybody's personal space and that's why I won't let my stuff spill into other's study area, which definitely is not the mentality I'd have at home. So, my room always just looks like it's just been broken into.

## 5. Do you keep your study area tidy?
Oh, yes! Although my room can sometime get quite disorganized, my study area is always tidy. I can go slightly OCD when it comes to the arrangement of all my school supplies and my textbooks and stuff. I need each of them to be at a particular position for the eternity of time so I can always find them. I also need there to be enough clean surface for me to work freely, so I'm constantly organizing my study surface and putting things in order.
