[NVIDIA provides OpenGL-accelerated Remote Desktop for GeForce](https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks)

In these days of social distancing, game developers and content creators all over the world are working from home and asking for help using Windows Remote Desktop streaming with the OpenGL tools they use.

NVIDIA has created a special tool for GeForce GPUs to accelerate Windows Remote Desktop streaming with GeForce drivers R440 or later.

Download and run the executable (nvidiaopenglrdp.exe) from the DesignWorks website as Administrator on the remote Windows PC where your OpenGL application will run. A dialog will confirm that OpenGL acceleration is enabled for Remote Desktop and if a reboot is required.)
