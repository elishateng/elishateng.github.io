## Top front-end frameworks

* **React**: A library developed by Facebook, React is popular for building reusable UI components. It uses a virtual DOM for efficient updates and is highly flexible, making it a strong choice for large, data-driven applications.

* **Angular**: Developed by Google, Angular is a full-fledged framework that uses TypeScript. It provides a structured and comprehensive environment, making it ideal for large-scale enterprise applications, though it has a steeper learning curve.

* **Vue.js**: A versatile and easy-to-learn framework that can be adopted incrementally. It's suitable for projects of all sizes and is often praised for its beginner-friendly nature and fast development speed.

* **Svelte**: A compiler that shifts work from the browser to the build step. It is praised for its high performance and low learning curve, making it great for smaller projects, although its community is smaller than the big three.

* **Ember.js**: An opinionated framework that follows a convention-over-configuration approach. It is well-suited for building complex, large-scale applications and is best for teams who prefer a more structured environment.

* **[Valdi](https://github.com/Snapchat/Valdi)** is a cross-platform UI framework that delivers native performance without sacrificing developer velocity. Write your UI once in declarative TypeScript, and it compiles directly to native views on iOS, Android, and macOS—no web views, no JavaScript bridges.

* Other popular options: Other notable frameworks include Next.js, which is a framework built on top of React, Astro, which is known for its speed, and Nuxt, a framework based on Vue.js.
